# spectral_euler_zcs

This is a Python implementation of a higher order Eulerian scheme to solve the Zakharov–Craig–Sulem equations.
A spectral method is used, as in Dommermuth and Yue 1986 (DY1987)[^1] Knowles and Yeh 2018 (KY2018)[^2].
Documentation on the implementation was originally written in LaTeX, and can be found in the
[documentation directory](https://github.com/KelvinHamster/spectral_euler_zcs/tree/master/documentation).
