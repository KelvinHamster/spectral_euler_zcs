{\bf\huge Figure 2}

All figures use $\varepsilon_0 = 0.2,\mu_0 = 0.15$
Wave profile on $y$-axis with respect to distance on $x$-axis. Left column for $\frac{P_0}{\varepsilon_0} = 0.05, \beta = 0.015$ and right column for $\frac{P_0}{\varepsilon_0} = 0.025, \beta = 0.025$.

\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Fig2.png}

Removed the plots at time $0$, and included plots at the thresholds for Fr $=\frac{1}{2}$ and Fr $=\frac{2}{3}$ (By threshold, we mean the first recorded instance of the wave being greater).
The other two are the same as in the manuscript (1/3 threshold, and half the time to that threshold).
\pagebreak


{\bf\huge Figure 3}


We use $\frac{P_0}{\varepsilon_0} = \pm0.05, \beta = 0.015$. Column 1 is positive $P$, column 2 is negative $P$. Row 1 is profile $\eta/h_0$, row2 is slope $\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}$, row 3 is velocity $u/\sqrt{gh_0}$.

\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Fig3.png}

We use the same times as the manuscript, except we extend into the future by the same intervals. We should also be careful of $t=0$, because, like in Figure 2, we do not have a time where the wind is ``turned on." Perhaps we should consider re-plotting figures 2 and 3, but with offset times.

Wave velocity is calculated in the same manner as Simulator1D (in fact, we create a new instance of it and use the same functions):
$$|u| = \sqrt{(\phi^S_x)^2 + (1+\eta_x^2)w^2}$$

{\bf\huge Figure 4}

These are for $\beta = 0.015$.

We exclude the 0.3 max-Froude number indicator here.
